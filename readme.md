# Analysis of State Population - 2020 - 2024

## Overview
This project was intended to explore and create visualization of U.S. State population data for the purposes of demographic analysis.  It was intended as a learning project to apply data cleaning, visualization, and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) techniques.

## Objectives
- Learning to work with real-world Census Bureau data.
- Applying data cleaning methods in Python.  This includes stripping out metadata, handling missing data, and resolving formatting issues.
- Running exploratory data analysis to better understand the data
- Create visualization to identify outlier states and population trends.

## Usage


_TODO_


## Key Findings
- Just over 1/3 (33.507%) of the country's population is concentrated in the 4 highest population states (California, Texas, Florida, and New York)
- Utah is an outlier for states with the lowest percentage of population aged 18 and older (2.1% fewer).
- Higher percentages of population aged 18 and older are located in the northeast states (Massachussetts, Rhode Island, Maine, and Vermont).
- The distribution of states with older populations skews slightly towards the right (older populations).

## Next Steps
- Plot regional percentage of population 18 and older on to line graph "Percentage of 18 and older Population by State (Sorted)".
- Graph the state populations 18 and older and create a graph of the inverse.
- Calculate and graph the percentage of population 18 years and older as a percentage of the total U.S. population.
- Include previous years' data to identify population trends.  This can answer questions like.
  - Which states are getting growing faster?
  - Which states are aging more?

## Technologies
